// Concatenation, in the context of programming, is the operation of joining two strings together. 

var myString = "I come first. " + "I come second."
/* notice that their is a space in between the fullstop and the quote this is because when we 
concatenate the strings we want a space between them */

// if we console.log(myString) it would appear as "I come first. I come second."

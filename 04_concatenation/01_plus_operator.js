// Concatenation, in the context of programming, is the operation of joining two strings together. 

var myString = "Hey new programmer. " + "How are you?"
console.log(myString)
/* notice that their is a space in between the fullstop and the quote this is because when we 
concatenate the strings we want a space between them */

// if we console.log(myString) it would appear as Hi new Programmer. How are you?

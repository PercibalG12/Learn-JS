# Functions 

A function is a reusable block of code or programming statements designed to perform a certain task. A function is declared by a function key word followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). A parentheses can take a parameter.Paramaters work as slots for placeholder inputs that the function should receive. If a function takes a parameter it will be called with argument. An argument reffers to a specific value of js datatypes, it is alos the real value passed into the function.  A function can also take a default parameter. To store a data to a function, a function has to return certain data types. To get the value we call or invoke a function. 

```js
function isResuable(){
    console.log("heyyyyy")
}

isResuable()
```

- The paramater would go inside here 
![Alt text](/img/fun1.PNG "")

- The argument would  would go inside here 
![Alt text](/img/fun2.PNG "")

### Whenever a function ius called or invoked the code inside the {} would be ran 

- When the argument ![Alt text](/img/fun2.PNG "") is called then the code 
![Alt text](/img/fun3.PNG "") would be ran

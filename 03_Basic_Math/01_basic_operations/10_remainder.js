/*  the ramainder operator (%) gets the remainder of the division of two numbers. 
It is often times reffred to as the modulus operator but the two are actually different */

var remainder;
remainder = 11 % 3;

// In this case  11 /3 = 9 and 11-9  is equal to 2 and so the remainder is 2 


// use cases

// the remainder operator is often used to see if a number is even or odd.

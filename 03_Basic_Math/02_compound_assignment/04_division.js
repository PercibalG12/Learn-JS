// image we  want to divide any number to an initialized variable for example 

var a = 60;

// we can do 

// a = a / 2;  
// this works fine but it is a bit repetitive so we can instead use the compound division operator (/=)

a /= 10;
console.log(a)

// this simply divides 4 fby 2 as 4 was assigned to a which would return a value of 2

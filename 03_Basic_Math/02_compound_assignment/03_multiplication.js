// image we  want to multiply any number to an initialized variable for example 

var a = 4;

// we can do 

a = a * 2;  
// this works fine but it is a bit repetitive so we can instead use the compound multiplication operator (*=)

a *= 2;

// this simply multiplys 4 by 2 as 4 was assigned to a which would return a value of 8

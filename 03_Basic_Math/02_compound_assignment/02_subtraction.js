// image we  want to subtract any number to an initialized variable for example 

var a = 4;

// we can do 

a = a - 2;  
// this works fine but it is a bit repetitive so we can instead use the compound subtraction operator (-=)

a -= 2;

// this simply subtracts 2 from 4 as 4 was assigned to a which would return a value of 2

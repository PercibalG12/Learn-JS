// image we  want to add any number to an initialized variable for example 

var a = 4;

// we can do 

a = a + 8;  
// this works fine but it is a bit repetitive so we can instaed use the compound addition operator (+=)

a += 8;

// this simply adds 8 to 4 as 4 was assigned to a which would return a value of 12

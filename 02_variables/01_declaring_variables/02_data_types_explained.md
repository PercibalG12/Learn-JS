# Undefined

Undefined means that  avariable hasent been defined or simply put it has only been declared with noting assigned to it for example (var myVar) is undefined  because it has not been initialized ;

```js
let firstName
console.log(firstName) //not defined, because it is not assigned to a value yet
```


# String 

A string is a text  in "" or ''

```js
let string = ""

```

Number is a number 

null means nothing - this can mean something is set to sokmething an that something is nothing.


# Boolean
Boolean means true or false. The use of these data types will be clear when you start the comparison operator. Any comparisons return a boolean value which is either true or false.


## Truthy values

- All numbers(positive and negative) are truthy except zero
- All strings are truthy except an empty string ('')
- The boolean true

## Falsy values

- 0
- 0n
- null
- undefined
- NaN
- the boolean false
- '', "", ``, empty string

It is good to remember those truthy values and falsy values. 


symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique (more onthat later in ....) 

Objects store key value pairs (more on that later in ...)


Data types can be divided into two:

Primitive data types
Non-primitive data types(Object References)


## Primitive data types in JavaScript include:

Numbers - Integers, floats
Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote
Booleans - true or false value
Null - empty value or no value
Undefined - a declared variable without a value
Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor


 Primitive data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it.


## Non-primitive data types in JavaScript includes:

Objects
Arrays

Non-primitive data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it gets created. Let us see by creating an array. 


## Note well

If you struggle to understand the difference between primitive and none-primitive data types don't worry just continue reading and practicing by making up your own exercises and you will get there!

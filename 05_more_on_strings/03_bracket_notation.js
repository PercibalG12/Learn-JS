// bracket notation is a way to get a specific character at an index within a string 


var firstName = "Percival"

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];
console.log(firstLetterOfFirstName)

/*  the brackets [] with the number 0 reffers to the bracket notation 
 if we log it out it would return the letter P 
this is so because in js we use zero based indexing which means that js starts counting
 from 0 instead of 1 */

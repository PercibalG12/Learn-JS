# Loops

Most of the activities we do in life are full of repetitions. Imagine if I ask you to print out from 0 to 100 using console.log(). To implement this simple task it may take you 2 to 5 minutes, such kind of tedious and repetitive task can be carried out using loop. 



### break

Break is used to interrupt a loop.

```js
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  if(i == 3){
    break
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2
```

The above code stops if 3 found in the iteration process.


### continue

We use the keyword *continue* to skip a certain iterations. 

```js
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  if(i == 3){
    continue
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2 4 5
```

# Array Length

We use the length property to find the length of an array.
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(numbers.length) // -> 5 is the size of the array
```


```js
const numbers = [0, 4, 18, 37, 98, 100] 
const ytChannels = ['cods', 'javascriptmastery', 'webdevsimplified', 'aniakubow','freecodecamp'] 




// Print the array and its length

console.log( numbers)
console.log('Number of numbers:', numbers.length)
// this will be shown as  Number of numbers: 6 in the console because when we add a string then a variable js knows we want to log out what that strings says and then follow it up with whatever the value of the variable we add next is.
 


console.log( ytChannels)
console.log( ytChannels.length)




```

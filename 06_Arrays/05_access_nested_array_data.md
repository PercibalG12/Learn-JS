# We can access nested arrays data using it's index

We do this by using bracket notation.The first notation points to the index of the array and the second notation points to the elemnt in the array 0f the first notation.

- For example

```js
const arr = [["PERCI", 42], [1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 0]];
const ourArr =  arr [1][0]
console.log(ourArr)
/* It would return the element 1  as the first notation points
 to the second arry and the second notation points to the firts elemt in that array 
 */ 
```
